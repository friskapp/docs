# Requirements

Frisk has the same requirements as [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master#server-requirements) which is basically a server with PHP 7.3+ and MySQL installed.

## PHP
- php-mcrypt
- php-bcmath
- php-ctype (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-fileinfo (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-json (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-mbstring (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-xml (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-openssl (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)
- php-pdo (enabled by default unless disabled at compile time)

## MySQL 
We have tested Frisk on version 5.7 and 8.0, so it's your choice but we recommend using latest version.
 
 ## Server
 You can any server platform but we recommend using Nginx.
