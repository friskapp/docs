## [Adding members to a project](#adding-members)
You can easily add members to any project (if you are an admin or a project manager) from project settings -> members. If you add a member, an invitation will be sent to his/her. You can also select the role of the member while adding.

## [Members roles](#members-roles)
A project member can have either a member role or a manager role. Manager role is the same as member role but with permission to access and manage the project settings  (except deleting the project which require an admin account).
