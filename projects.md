## [What's a project in Frisk?](#what-a-project)
A project in Frisk can be created to track errors of one website/app. A project is like a folder that contains all errors of a website and you can assign specific members to access and manage them.

## [Creating a project](#creating-admin-account)
In order to create a project in your Frisk App you have to be an **admin** ([see: how to create an admin account](./after-installing-frisk#creating-admin-account));
then from the top menu select "Create A Project".

> {note} Make sure to add the correct domain/domains of your tracked website, this is very important for CORS protection.
