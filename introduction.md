## [Frisk's Main Features](#frisk-features)
- Privacy; because it's self-hosted. Your errors & logs are safe in your hands not others.
- Privacy; because your team information and identities are not recorded with thousands of others.
- Privacy; because code snippets you share are shared by you and hosted by you.
- Unlimited everything; you don't have to upgrade to a different plan to just add another member to a team! or to get an error that happens a year ago because of the retention limits! you host it .. you control it.
- Customization Freedom; you can change, edit or add features because you are (and I bet on that) a developer and developers can't use a thing without tinkering with it :).

## [Integration with Laravel](#integration-with-laravel)
Frisk was built originally for Laravel to be an affordable and self-hosted solution that integrate with Laravel's Ignition smoothly. It was built in the beginning for Awssat team to be used internally for our projects because we didn't find an alternative solution that is a self-hosted (privacy) and directed specifically to Laravel (Ignition). We decided to add some other features and release it as a paid product and we plan to keep improving it to help other teams and companies that has the same requirements in error tracking solution like us.

## [Is Frisk really affordable?](#affordability)
If you don't care about privacy and you care about affordability then it's ok; you can compare a yearly plan of other solutions with Frisk's license price plus a $5 digitalOcean (or $2.5 Vultr) VPS server per year and will know it's affordable because you will get unlimited everything with no retention limits.
