# Getting Frisk Support 

These documentation pages considered a way of support, we will try to update the docs to make the user find answers to almost any inquiry. We also have other support channels: 

- A discussion board on [github/frisk-support](https://github.com/frisk/frisk-support), for common questions and we will try to answer them weekly.
- For those who purchased a **Pro** licence, you can find our email on your licence page for the email support.
